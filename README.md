# Car Affordability Calculator
## Description
The Car Affordability Calculator is a Python-based tool designed to help individuals assess the financial implications of purchasing a vehicle. It considers various factors such as fuel costs, maintenance, insurance, loan details, and more to provide an insightful cost analysis. This tool is especially useful for buyers looking to compare the long-term costs of different vehicles.

## How Does It Work?

The calculator operates through a series of interactive prompts in the terminal, where users input details about their prospective car purchases. It processes this data to compute and compare costs associated with different vehicles. The core functionality includes:

- **Input Collection:** Gathering user data about the vehicles they wish to compare (e.g., make, model, MPG).
- **Cost Calculation:** Estimating monthly and yearly costs based on fuel efficiency, driving habits, and financial details.
- **Comparison and Recommendation:** Analyzing data to recommend the most cost-effective vehicle based on total ownership costs and other specified criteria.
